                Hey there! I'm a
                <span class="font-semibold text-gray-100"
                    ><span class="age-text">20</span>-year-old tech enthusiast</span
                >
                with a growing set of skills in web development, automation,
                cloud computing, and AI. I'm well-versed in languages and
                frameworks such as
                <span class="font-semibold text-gray-100"
                    >Node.js, Python, React Native, Flask, and Express.js</span
                >. I also have experience working with cloud services like
                <span class="font-semibold text-gray-100">Azure</span>, as well
                as tools for automation and web scraping</span>.

                My journey into coding began at 17, when I dreamt of building
                the next big video game. Fast forward a few years, and Iâ€™m now
                immersed in a variety of technologies, tackling projects that
                range from web development to AI and machine learning. The path
                has been full of learning moments, exciting discoveries, and a
                bit of frustration (mostly from debugging!). But at the end of
                the day, I enjoy every line of code.
